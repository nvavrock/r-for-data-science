# README: R for Data Science – Workflow Basics Audit

## Project Overview
This module documents a systematic review of **Chapter 2: Workflow Basics**. The objective was to evaluate the chapter for actionable technical examples or data transformation opportunities suitable for high-level repository documentation.

---

## Audit Findings
Following a comprehensive review of the curriculum materials provided in this section, it was determined that the chapter focuses exclusively on foundational environmental mechanics. 

* **Artifact Scoping:** The review did not yield specific technical examples or datasets that warranted the creation of complex visualization or transformation scripts.
* **Conceptual Review:** The content remains restricted to basic RStudio operations, such as object assignment and functional calling conventions.
* **Conclusion:** This module is classified as a "Review Only" phase; no substantive technical artifacts were generated to avoid the inclusion of redundant or trivial code within the repository.
