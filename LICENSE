ATTRIBUTION NOTICE:
This repository contains original code, documentation, and automated workflows 
created as a systematic audit and iterative refinement of the curriculum 
presented in "R for Data Science (2e)" by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, 
and Garrett Grolemund. 

While the interpretive logic, accessibility modifications, and filesystem 
automation protocols are original works, the pedagogical framework and 
underlying datasets (e.g., palmerpenguins) are derived from the R4DS 
ecosystem and the associated Tidyverse documentation.
